/**
 * The NApiCore namespace encompasses all interface declarations
 * for the supported APIs and their various supported versions.
 *
 * All API instances are based on the IApi interface which provides
 * common methods to all APIs.
 *
 * Two types of API are then defined:
 *
 * Base APIs - Providing access to top level areas of EDEM
 * such as the field manager or geometry manager.
 *
 * Sub APIs - Providing access to individual data elements such
 * as a specific field data instance or geometry group.
 *
 * Each API consists of a number of public interfaces of differing
 * major and minor version numbers (e.g. IFieldApi_1_0, IFieldApi_1_1,
 * IFieldApi_2_0).  Minor revisions are only allowed to add new functions
 * and not change the definitions of earlier versions.  All minor
 * versions derive from the immediately previous versions interface
 * (e.g. IFieldApi_1_1 derives from IFieldApi_1_0).  Major revisions are
 * complete re-workings of the interface.  The X.0 version of an
 * interface stands alone and does not derive from any previous version.
 *
 * The API Manager is responsible for the creation and initialization
 * of base APIs.  Sub APIs are created by a corresponding base API.
 * (e.g IFieldApi_?_? instances are created by IFieldManager_?_?)
